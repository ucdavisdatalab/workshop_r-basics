In this\nchapter, you'll learn how to efficiently explore and summarize data with\nvisualizations and statistics. Along the way, you'll also learn how to use\napply functions, which are essential to fluency in R.\n\n\n## Indexing Data Frames\n\nThis section explains how to get and set data in a data frame, expanding on the\nindexing techniques you learned in @sec-indexing. Under the hood, every data\nframe is a list, so first you'll learn about indexing lists.\n\n\n### Indexing Lists\n\nLists are a **container** for other types of R objects. When you select an\nelement from a list, you can either keep the container (the list) or discard\nit. The indexing operator `[` almost always keeps containers.\n\nAs an example, let's get some elements from a small list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx = list(first = c(1, 2, 3), second = sin, third = c(\"hi\", \"hello\"))\ny = x[c(1, 3)]\ny\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$first\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n$third\n[1] \"hi\"    \"hello\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"list\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is still a list. Even if we get just one element, the result of\nindexing a list with `[` is a list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(x[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"list\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes this will be exactly what we want. But what if we want to get the\nfirst element of `x` so that we can use it in a vectorized function? Or in a\nfunction that only accepts numeric arguments? We need to somehow get the\nelement and discard the container.\n\nThe solution to this problem is the **extraction operator** `[[`, which is also\ncalled the double square bracket operator. The extraction operator is the\nprimary way to get and set elements of lists and other containers.\n\nUnlike the indexing operator `[`, the extraction operator always discards the\ncontainer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx[[1]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(x[[1]])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tradeoff is that the extraction operator can only get or set one element at\na time. Note that the element can be a vector, as above. Because it can only\nget or set one element at a time, the extraction operator can only index by\nposition or name. Blank and logical indexes are not allowed.\n\nThe final difference between the index operator `[` and the extraction operator\n`[[` has to do with how they handle invalid indexes. The index operator `[`\nreturns `NA` for invalid vector elements, and `NULL` for invalid list elements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(1, 2)[10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx[10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$<NA>\nNULL\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the extraction operator `[[` raises an error for invalid\nelements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx[[10]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in x[[10]]: subscript out of bounds\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe indexing operator `[` and the extraction operator `[[` both work with any\ndata structure that has elements. However, you'll generally use the indexing\noperator `[` to index vectors, and the extraction operator `[[` to index\ncontainers (such as lists).\n\n\n### Two-dimensional Indexing\n\nFor two-dimensional objects, like matrices and data frames, you can pass the\nindexing operator `[` or the extraction operator `[[` a separate index for each\ndimension. The rows come first:\n\n```\nDATA[ROWS, COLUMNS]\n```\n\nFor instance, let's get the first 3 rows and all columns of the banknotes data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbanknotes[1:3, ]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  currency_code   country    currency_name                       name gender\n1           ARS Argentina Argentinian Peso                  Eva Perón      F\n2           ARS Argentina Argentinian Peso       Julio Argentino Roca      M\n3           ARS Argentina Argentinian Peso Domingo Faustino Sarmiento      M\n  bill_count    profession known_for_being_first current_bill_value\n1          1      Activist                    No                100\n2          1 Head of Gov't                    No                100\n3          1 Head of Gov't                    No                 50\n  prop_total_bills first_appearance_year death_year comments hover_text\n1               NA                  2012       1952                    \n2               NA                  1988       1914                    \n3               NA                  1999       1888                    \n  has_portrait            id scaled_bill_value\n1         true     ARS_Evita         1.0000000\n2         true ARS_Argentino         1.0000000\n3         true   ARS_Domingo         0.4444444\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we saw in @sec-all-elements, leaving an index blank means all elements.\n\nAs another example, let's get the 3rd and 5th row, and the 2nd and 4th column:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbanknotes[c(3, 5), c(2, 4)]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    country                       name\n3 Argentina Domingo Faustino Sarmiento\n5 Argentina            Manuel Belgrano\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixing several different ways of indexing is allowed. So for example, we can\nget the same above, but use column names instead of positions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbanknotes[c(3, 5), c(\"currency_name\", \"name\")]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     currency_name                       name\n3 Argentinian Peso Domingo Faustino Sarmiento\n5 Argentinian Peso            Manuel Belgrano\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor data frames, it's especially common to index the rows by condition and the\ncolumns by name. For instance, let's get the `name` and `profession` columns\nfor all women in the banknotes data set:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresult = banknotes[banknotes$gender == \"F\", c(\"name\", \"profession\")]\nhead(result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                 name profession\n1           Eva Perón   Activist\n7        Mary Gilmore     Writer\n10        Edith Cowan Politician\n11       Nellie Melba   Musician\n13        Mary Reibey      Other\n14 Queen Elizabeth II    Monarch\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso see @sec-the-drop-parameter for a case where the `[` operator behaves in a\nsurprising way.\n\n\n## Packages {#sec-packages}\n\nA **package** is a collection of functions for use in R. Packages usually\ninclude documentation, and can also contain examples, vignettes, and data sets.\nMost packages are developed by members of the R community, so quality varies.\nThere are also a few packages that are built into R but provide extra features.\nWe'll use a package in @sec-data-visualization, so we're learning about them\nnow.\n\nThe [Comprehensive R Archive Network][cran], or CRAN, is the main place people\npublish packages. As of writing, there were 18,619 packages posted to CRAN.\nThis number has been steadily increasing as R has grown in popularity.\n\n[cran]: https://cran.r-project.org/\n\nPackages span a wide variety of topics and disciplines. There are packages\nrelated to statistics, social sciences, geography, genetics, physics, biology,\npharmacology, economics, agriculture, and more. The best way to find packages\nis to search online, but the CRAN website also provides [\"task\nviews\"][cran-task-views] if you want to browse popular packages related to a\nspecific discipline.\n\n[cran-task-views]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/\n\nThe `install.packages` function installs one or more packages from CRAN. Its\nfirst argument is the packages to install, as a character vector.\n\nWhen you run `install.packages`, R will ask you to choose which **mirror** to\ndownload the package from. A mirror is a web server that has the same set of\nfiles as some other server. Mirrors are used to make downloads faster and to\nprovide redundancy so that if a server stops working, files are still available\nsomewhere else. CRAN has dozens of mirrors; you should choose one that's\ngeographically nearby, since that usually produces the best download speeds. If\nyou aren't sure which mirror to choose, you can use the 0-Cloud mirror, which\nattempts to automatically choose a mirror near you.\n\nAs an example, here's the code to install the remotes package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you run the code above, you'll be asked to select a mirror, and then see\noutput that looks something like this:\n\n```\n--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---\ntrying URL 'https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/remotes_2.3.0.tar.gz'\nContent type 'application/x-gzip' length 148405 bytes (144 KB)\n==================================================\ndownloaded 144 KB\n\n* installing *source* package ‘remotes’ ...\n** package ‘remotes’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n** using staged installation\n** R\n** inst\n** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading\n** help\n*** installing help indices\n** building package indices\n** installing vignettes\n** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location\n** testing if installed package can be loaded from final location\n** testing if installed package keeps a record of temporary installation path\n* DONE (remotes)\n\nThe downloaded source packages are in\n        ‘/tmp/Rtmp8t6iGa/downloaded_packages’\n```\n\nR goes through a variety of steps to install a package, even installing other\npackages that the package depends on. You can tell that a package installation\nsucceeded by the final line `DONE`. When a package installation fails, R prints\nan error message explaining the problem instead.\n\nOnce a package is installed, it stays on your computer until you remove it or\nremove R. This means you only need to install each package once. However, most\npackages are periodically updated. You can reinstall a package using\n`install.packages` the same way as above to get the latest version.\n\nAlternatively, you can update all of the R packages you have installed at once\nby calling the `update.packages` function. Beware that this may take a long\ntime if you have a lot of packages installed.\n\nThe function to remove packages is `remove.packages`. Like `install.packages`,\nthis function's first argument is the packages to remove, as a character\nvector.\n\nIf you want to see which packages are installed, you can use the\n`installed.packages` function. It does not require any arguments. It returns a\nmatrix with one row for each package and columns that contain a variety of\ninformation. Here's an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npackages = installed.packages()\n# Just print the version numbers for 10 packages.\npackages[1:10, \"Version\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     abind        ape    askpass assertthat  backports  base64enc         BH \n   \"1.4-5\"      \"5.8\"    \"1.2.0\"    \"0.2.1\"    \"1.4.1\"    \"0.1-3\" \"1.84.0-0\" \n       bit      bit64     bitops \n   \"4.0.5\"    \"4.0.5\"    \"1.0-7\" \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll see a different set of packages, since you have a different computer.\n\nBefore you can use the functions (or other resources) in an installed package,\nyou must load the package with the `library` function. R doesn't load packages\nautomatically because each package you load uses memory and may conflict with\nother packages. Thus you should only load the packages you need for whatever\nit is that you want to do. When you restart R, the loaded packages are cleared\nand you must again load any packages you want to use.\n\nLet's load the remotes package we installed earlier:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"remotes\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `library` function works with or without quotes around the package name, so\nyou may also see people write things like `library(remotes)`. We recommend\nusing quotes to make it unambiguous that you are not referring to a variable.\n\nA handful of packages print out a message when loaded, but the vast majority do\nnot. Thus you can assume the call to `library` was successful if nothing is\nprinted. If something goes wrong while loading a package, R will print out an\nerror message explaining the problem.\n\nFinally, not all R packages are published to CRAN. [GitHub][gh] is another\npopular place to publish R packages, especially ones that are experimental or\nstill in development. Unlike CRAN, GitHub is a general-purpose website for\npublishing code written in any programming language, so it contains much more\nthan just R packages and is not specifically R-focused.\n\n[gh]: https://github.com/\n\nThe remotes package that we just installed and loaded provides functions to\ninstall packages from GitHub. It is generally better to install packages from\nCRAN when they are available there, since the versions on CRAN tend to be more\nstable and intended for a wide audience. However, if you want to install a\npackage from GitHub, you can learn more about the remotes package by reading\nits [online documentation][remotes].\n\n[remotes]: https://remotes.r-lib.org/\n\n\n\n## Data Visualization {#sec-data-visualization}\n\nThere are three popular systems for creating visualizations in R:\n\n1. The base R functions (primarily the `plot` function)\n2. The lattice package\n3. The ggplot2 package\n\nThese three systems are not interoperable! Consequently, it's best to choose\none to use exclusively. Compared to base R, both lattice and ggplot2 are better\nat handling grouped data and generally require less code to create a\nnice-looking visualization.\n\nThe ggplot2 package is so popular that there are now knockoff packages for\nother data-science-oriented programming languages like Python and Julia. The\npackage is also part of the [Tidyverse][tidy], a popular collection of R\npackages designed to work well together. Because of these advantages, we'll use\nggplot2 for visualizations in this and all future lessons.\n\n[tidy]: https://www.tidyverse.org/\n\nggplot2 has detailed [documentation][ggplot2-docs] and also a\n[cheatsheet][ggplot2-cheat].\n\n[ggplot2-docs]: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/\n[ggplot2-cheat]: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf\n\nThe \"gg\" in ggplot2 stands for **grammar of graphics**. The idea of a grammar\nof graphics is that visualizations can be built up in layers. In ggplot2, the\nthree layers every plot must have are:\n\n* Data\n* Geometry\n* Aesthetics\n\nThere are also several optional layers. Here are a few:\n\nLayer       | Description\n----------  | -----------\nscales      | Title, label, and axis value settings\nfacets      | Side-by-side plots\nguides      | Axis and legend position settings\nannotations | Shapes that are not mapped to data\ncoordinates | Coordinate systems (Cartesian, logarithmic, polar)\n\n\nAs an example, let's plot the banknotes data. First, we need to load ggplot2.\nAs always, if this is your first time using the package, you'll have to install\nit. Then you can load the package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of plot should we make? It depends on what we want to know about the\ndata set. Suppose we want to understand the relationship between a banknote's\nvalue and how long ago the person on the banknote died, as well as whether this\nis affected by gender. One way to show this is to make a scatter plot.\n\n<!-- FIXME: Move this type correction to chapter 2 -->\nBefore plotting, we need to make sure that the `death_year` column is numeric:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nis_blank = banknotes$death_year %in% c(\"\", \"-\")\nbanknotes$death_year[is_blank] = NA\nbanknotes$death_year = as.numeric(banknotes$death_year)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we're ready to make the plot.\n\n### Layer 1: Data\n\nThe data layer determines the data set used to make the plot. ggplot and most\nother Tidyverse packages are designed for working with **tidy** data frames.\nTidy means:\n\n1. Each observation has its own row.\n2. Each feature has its own column.\n3. Each value has its own cell.\n\nTidy data sets are convenient in general. A later lesson will cover how to make\nan untidy data set tidy. Until then, we'll take it for granted that the data\nsets we work with are tidy.\n\nTo set up the data layer, call the `ggplot` function on a data frame:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis returns a blank plot. We still need to add a few more layers.\n\n\n### Layer 2: Geometry\n\nThe **geom**etry layer determines the shape or appearance of the visual\nelements of the plot. In other words, the geometry layer determines what kind\nof plot to make: one with points, lines, boxes, or something else.\n\nThere are many different geometries available in ggplot2. The package provides\na function for each geometry, always prefixed with `geom_`.\n\nTo add a geometry layer to the plot, choose the `geom_` function you want and\nadd it to the plot with the `+` operator:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `geom_point()`:\n! Problem while setting up geom.\ni Error occurred in the 1st layer.\nCaused by error in `compute_geom_1()`:\n! `geom_point()` requires the following missing aesthetics: x and y.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis returns an error message that we're missing aesthetics `x` and `y`. We'll\nlearn more about aesthetics in the next section, but this error message is\nespecially helpful: it tells us exactly what we're missing. When you use a\ngeometry you're unfamiliar with, it can be helpful to run the code for just the\ndata and geometry layer like this, to see exactly which aesthetics need to be\nset.\n\nAs we'll see later, it's possible to add multiple geometries to a plot.\n\n\n### Layer 3: Aesthetics\n\nThe **aes**thetic layer determines the relationship between the data and the\ngeometry. Use the aesthetic layer to map features in the data to **aesthetics**\n(visual elements) of the geometry.\n\nThe `aes` function creates an aesthetic layer. The syntax is:\n```\naes(AESTHETIC = FEATURE, ...)\n```\n\nThe names of the aesthetics depend on the geometry, but some common ones are\n`x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, `shape`, and `size`. There is more information about\nand examples of aesthetic names in the documentation.\n\nFor example, we want to put `death_year` on the x-axis and `scaled_bill_value`\non the y-axis. It's best to use `scaled_bill_value` here rather than\n`current_bill_value` because the different countries use different scales of\ncurrency. For example, 1 United States Dollar is worth approximately 100\nJapanese Yen. So the aesthetic layer should be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  geom_point() +\n  aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-18-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the `aes` function, column names are never quoted. In older versions of\nggplot2, you must pass the aesthetic layer as the second argument of the\n`ggplot` function rather than using `+` to add it to the plot. This syntax is\nstill widely used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes, aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-19-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Per-geometry Aesthetics {-}\n\nWhen you add the aesthetic layer or pass it to the `ggplot` function, it\napplies to the entire plot. You can also set an aesthetic layer individually\nfor each geometry, by passing the layer as the first argument in the `geom_`\nfunction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is really only useful when you have multiple geometries.

To do this, we need to add another\ngeometry:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  geom_point() +\n  aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value, color = gender, label = name) +\n  geom_text()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_text()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-22-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere we put the aesthetics matters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  geom_point() +\n  aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value, label = name) +\n  geom_text(aes(color = gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_text()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Constant Aesthetics {-}\n\nIf you want to set an aesthetic to a constant value, rather than one that's\ndata dependent, do so in the geometry layer rather than the aesthetic layer.\nFor instance, suppose use point shape rather than color to indicate gender, and\nwe want to make all of the points blue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value, shape = gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-24-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set an aesthetic to a constant value inside of the aesthetic layer, the\nresults you get might not be what you expect:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  geom_point() +\n  aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value, shape = gender, color = \"blue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-25-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Layer 4: Scales\n\nThe scales layer controls the title, axis labels, and axis scales of the plot.\nMost of the functions in the scales layer are prefixed with `scale_`, but not\nall of them.\n\nThe `labs` function is especially important, because it's used to set the title\nand axis labels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  geom_point() +\n  aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value, shape = gender) +\n  labs(x = \"Death Year\", y = \"Scaled Bill Value\",\n    title = \"Does death year affect bill value?\", shape = \"Gender\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-26-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Saving Plots\n\nIn ggplot2, use the `ggsave` function to save the most recent plot you created:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(\"banknote_scatter.png\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file format is selected automatically based on the extension. Common\nformats are PNG and PDF.\n\n#### The Plot Device {-}\n\nYou can also save a plot with one of R's \"plot device\" functions. The steps\nare:\n\n1. Call a plot device function: `png`, `jpeg`, `pdf`, `bmp`, `tiff`, or `svg`.\n2. Run your code to make the plot.\n3. Call `dev.off` to indicate that you're done plotting.\n\nThis strategy works with any of R's graphics systems (not just ggplot2).\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Run these lines in the console, not the notebook!\njpeg(\"banknote_scatter.jpeg\")\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  geom_point() +\n  aes(x = death_year, y = scaled_bill_value, shape = gender) +\n  labs(x = \"Death Year\", y = \"Scaled Bill Value\",\n    title = \"Does death year affect bill value?\", shape = \"Gender\")\ndev.off()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Example: Bar Plot\n\nNow suppose you want to plot the number of banknotes with people from each\nprofession in the banknotes data set. A bar plot is in an appropriate way to\nrepresent this visually.\n\nThe geometry for a bar plot is `geom_bar`. Since bar plots are mainly used to\ndisplay frequencies, the `geom_bar` function automatically computes frequencies\nwhen given mapped to a categorical feature.\n\nWe can also use a fill color to further breakdown the bars by gender. Here's\nthe code to make the bar plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(banknotes) +\n  aes(x = profession, fill = gender) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_exploring-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-29-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe setting `position = \"dodge\"` instructs `geom_bar` to put the bars\nside-by-side rather than stacking them.\n\nIn some cases, you may want to make a bar plot with frequencies you've already\ncomputed. To prevent `geom_bar` from computing frequencies automatically, set\n`stat = \"identity\"`.\n\n\n### Visualization Design\n\nDesigning high-quality visualizations goes beyond just mastering which R\nfunctions to call. You also need to think carefully about what kind of data you\nhave and what message you want to convey. This section provides a few\nguidelines.\n\nThe first step in data visualization is choosing an appropriate kind of plot.\nHere are some suggestions (not rules):\n\n| Feature 1   | Feature 2   | Plot\n| :---------- |:----------- |:----\n| categorical |             | bar, dot\n| categorical | categorical | bar, dot, mosaic\n| numerical   |             | box, density, histogram\n| numerical   | categorical | box, density, ridge\n| numerical   | numerical   | line, scatter, smooth scatter\n\nIf you want to add a:\n\n* 3rd numerical feature, use it to change point/line sizes.\n* 3rd categorical feature, use it to change point/line styles.\n* 4th categorical feature, use side-by-side plots.\n\nOnce you've selected a plot, here are some rules you should almost always\nfollow:\n\n* Always add a title and axis labels. These should be in plain English, not\n  variable names!\n\n* Specify units after the axis label if the axis has units. For instance,\n  \"Height (ft)\".\n\n* Don't forget that many people are colorblind! Also, plots are often printed\n  in black and white. Use point and line styles to distinguish groups; color is\n  optional.\n\n* Add a legend whenever you've used more than one point or line style.\n\n* Always write a few sentences explaining what the plot reveals. Don't\n  describe the plot, because the reader can just look at it. Instead,\n  explain what they can learn from the plot and point out important details\n  that are easily overlooked.\n\n* Sometimes points get plotted on top of each other. This is called\n  _overplotting_. Plots with a lot of overplotting can be hard to read and can\n  even misrepresent the data by hiding how many points are present. Use a\n  two-dimensional density plot or jitter the points to deal with overplotting.\n\n* For side-by-side plots, use the same axis scales for both plots so that\n  comparing them is not deceptive.\n\nVisualization design is a deep topic, and whole books have been written about\nit. One resource where you can learn more is DataLab's [Principles of Data\nVisualization Workshop Reader][dataviz].\n\n[dataviz]: https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_data_viz_principles/\n\nApply Functions\n---------------\n\n@sec-vectorization introduced vectorization, a convenient and efficient way to\ncompute multiple results. That section also mentioned that some of R's\nfunctions---the ones that summarize or aggregate data---are not vectorized.\n\nThe `class` function is an example of a function that's not vectorized. If we\ncall the `class` function on the banknotes data set, we get just one result for\nthe data set as a whole:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(banknotes)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we want to get the class of each column? We can get the class for a\nsingle column by selecting the column with `$`, the dollar sign operator:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(banknotes$currency_code)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what if we want the classes for all the columns? We could write a call to\n`class` for each column, but that would be tedious. When you're working with a\nprogramming language, you should try to avoid tedium; there's usually a better,\nmore automated way.\n\n@sec-lists pointed out that data frames are technically lists, where each\ncolumn is one element. With that in mind, what we need here is a line of code\nthat calls `class` on each element of the data frame. The idea is similar to\nvectorization, but since we have a list and a non-vectorized function, we have\nto do a bit more than just call `class(banknotes)`.\n\nThe `lapply` function calls, or _applies_, a function on each element of a list\nor vector. The syntax is:\n\n```\nlapply(X, FUN, ...)\n```\n\nThe function `FUN` is called once for each element of `X`, with the element as\nthe first argument. The `...` is for additional arguments to `FUN`, which are\nheld constant across all the elements.\n\nLet's try this out with the banknotes data and the `class` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlapply(banknotes, class)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$currency_code\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$country\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$currency_name\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$name\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$gender\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$bill_count\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$profession\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$known_for_being_first\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$current_bill_value\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n$prop_total_bills\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$first_appearance_year\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n$death_year\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$comments\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$hover_text\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$has_portrait\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$id\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$scaled_bill_value\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is similar to if the `class` function was vectorized. In fact, if we\nuse a vector and a vectorized function with `lapply`, the result is nearly\nidentical to the result from vectorization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx = c(1, 2, pi)\n\nsin(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8.414710e-01 9.092974e-01 1.224647e-16\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlapply(x, sin)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.841471\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 0.9092974\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 1.224647e-16\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only difference is that the result from `lapply` is a list. In fact, the\n`lapply` function always returns a list with one element for each element of\nthe input data. The \"l\" in `lapply` stands for \"list\".\n\nThe `lapply` function is one member of a family of functions called _apply\nfunctions_. All of the apply functions provide ways to apply a function\nrepeatedly to different parts of a data structure. We'll meet a few more apply\nfunctions soon.\n\nWhen you have a choice between using vectorization or an apply function, you\nshould always choose vectorization. Vectorization is clearer---compare the two\nlines of code above---and it's also significantly more efficient. In fact,\nvectorization is the most efficient way to call a function repeatedly in R.\n\nAs we saw with the `class` function, there are some situations where\nvectorization is not possible. That's when you should think about using an\napply function.\n\n### The `sapply` Function\n\nThe related `sapply` function calls a function on each element of a list or\nvector, and simplifies the result. That last part is the crucial difference\ncompared to `lapply`. When results from the calls all have the same type and\nlength, `sapply` returns a vector or matrix instead of a list. When the results\nhave different types or lengths, the result is the same as for `lapply`. The\n\"s\" in `sapply` stands for \"simplify\".\n\nFor instance, if we use `sapply` to find the classes of the columns in the\nbanknotes data, we get a character vector:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsapply(banknotes, class)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        currency_code               country         currency_name \n          \"character\"           \"character\"           \"character\" \n                 name                gender            bill_count \n          \"character\"           \"character\"             \"numeric\" \n           profession known_for_being_first    current_bill_value \n          \"character\"           \"character\"             \"integer\" \n     prop_total_bills first_appearance_year            death_year \n            \"numeric\"             \"integer\"             \"numeric\" \n             comments            hover_text          has_portrait \n          \"character\"           \"character\"           \"character\" \n                   id     scaled_bill_value \n          \"character\"             \"numeric\" \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, if we use `sapply` to compute the `sin` values, we get a numeric\nvector, the same as from vectorization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsapply(x, sin)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8.414710e-01 9.092974e-01 1.224647e-16\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spite of that, vectorization is still more efficient than `sapply`, so use\nvectorization instead when possible.\n\nApply functions are incredibly useful for summarizing data. For example,\nsuppose we want to compute the frequencies for all of the columns in the\nbanknotes data set that aren't numeric.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the columns. One way to do this is with the\n`is.numeric` function. Despite the name, this function actually tests whether\nits argument is a real number, not whether it its argument is a numeric vector.\nIn other words, it also returns true for integer values. We can use `sapply` to\napply this function to all of the columns in the banknotes data set:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nis_not_number = !sapply(banknotes, is.numeric)\nis_not_number\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        currency_code               country         currency_name \n                 TRUE                  TRUE                  TRUE \n                 name                gender            bill_count \n                 TRUE                  TRUE                 FALSE \n           profession known_for_being_first    current_bill_value \n                 TRUE                  TRUE                 FALSE \n     prop_total_bills first_appearance_year            death_year \n                FALSE                 FALSE                 FALSE \n             comments            hover_text          has_portrait \n                 TRUE                  TRUE                  TRUE \n                   id     scaled_bill_value \n                 TRUE                 FALSE \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it worth using R code to identify the non-numeric columns? Since there are\nonly 17 columns in the banknotes data set, maybe not. But if\nthe data set was larger, with say 100 columns, it definitely would be.\n\nIn general, it's a good habit to use R to do things rather than do them\nmanually. You'll get more practice programming, and your code will be more\nflexible if you want to adapt it to other data sets.\n\nNow that we know which columns are non-numeric, we can use the `table` function\nto compute frequencies. We only want to compute frequencies for those columns,\nso we need to subset the data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlapply(banknotes[, is_not_number], table)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$currency_code\n\nARS AUD BDT BOB CAD CLP COP CRC CVE CZK DOP GBP GEL IDR ILS ISK JMD JPY KGS KRW \n  5   9   9  15   9   5  11   6   5   6  11   8   9  12

set with categorical features, it's often useful to compute something\nfor each category.

The first argument to `split` is the data, and the\nsecond argument is a congruent vector of categories.\n\nWe can use `split` to elegantly compute means of `first_appearance_year` broken\ndown by country. First, we split the data by country. Since we only want to\ncompute on the `first_appearance_year` column, we only split that column:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nby_country = split(banknotes$first_appearance_year, banknotes$country)\nclass(by_country)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"list\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames(by_country)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"Argentina\"             \"Australia\"             \"Bangladesh\"           \n [4] \"Bolivia\"               \"Canada\"                \"Cape Verde\"           \n [7] \"Chile\"                 \"China\"                 \"Colombia\"             \n[10] \"Costa Rica\"            \"Czech Republic\"        \"Dominican Republic\"   \n[13] \"England\"               \"Georgia\"               \"Iceland\"              \n[16] \"Indonesia\"             \"Israel\"                \"Jamaica\"              \n[19] \"Japan\"                 \"Kyrgyzstan\"            \"Malawi\"               \n[22] \"Mexico\"                \"New Zealand\"           \"Nigeria\"              \n[25] \"Papua New Guinea\"      \"Peru\"                  \"Philippines\"          \n[28] \"São Tomé and Príncipe\" \"Serbia\"                \"South Africa\"         \n[31] \"South Korea\"           \"Sweden\"                \"Tunisia\"              \n[34] \"Turkey\"                \"Ukraine\"               \"United States\"        \n[37] \"Uruguay\"               \"Venezuela\"            \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe result from `split` is a list with one element for each category.

First you\nuse `split` to convert categories into list elements, then you use an apply\nfunction to compute something on each category. Any time you want to compute\nresults by category, you should think of this pattern.\n\nThe split-apply pattern is so useful that R provides the `tapply` function as a\nshortcut. The `tapply` function is equivalent to calling `split` and then\n`sapply`. Like `split`, the first argument is the data and the second argument\nis a congruent vector of categories. The third argument is a function to apply,\nlike the function argument in `sapply`.\n\nWe can use `tapply` to compute the `first_appearance_year` means by `country`\nfor the banknotes data set:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntapply(banknotes$first_appearance_year, banknotes$country, mean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n            Argentina             Australia            Bangladesh \n             1992.200              1990.778              1972.000 \n              Bolivia                Canada            Cape Verde \n             2010.667              1983.778              2014.000 \n                Chile                 China              Colombia \n             1988.600              1980.000              2001.727 \n           Costa Rica        Czech Republic    Dominican Republic \n             2002.667              1993.500              1991.545 \n              England               Georgia               Iceland \n             1994.000              1997.222              1991.800 \n            Indonesia                Israel               Jamaica \n             2004.750              2015.750              1989.000 \n                Japan            Kyrgyzstan                Malawi \n             1997.333              1998.714              2001.857 \n               Mexico           New Zealand               Nigeria \n             1988.545              1987.000              1994.667 \n     Papua New Guinea                  Peru           Philippines \n             1989.000              2000.143              1982.111 \nSão Tomé and Príncipe                Serbia          South Africa \n             1981.500              2005.111              2012.000 \n          South Korea                Sweden               Tunisia \n             1982.250              2015.167              2015.750 \n               Turkey               Ukraine         United States \n             1968.000              1997.000              1905.143 \n              Uruguay             Venezuela \n             1998.429              1991.500 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the result is identical to the one we computed before.\n\nThe \"t\" in `tapply` stands for \"table\", because the `tapply` function is a\ngeneralization of the `table` function.
